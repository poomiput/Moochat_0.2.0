**ðŸ”§ MooChat Bluetooth Connection Troubleshooting Guide**

## ðŸ“± **Current Issue: Devices Can't Connect/Send Messages**

You've successfully installed the MooChat app on both devices, but they're not discovering each other or connecting. Here's a comprehensive troubleshooting guide:

### âœ… **Step 1: Verify Basic Requirements**

**On BOTH devices:**

1. **Bluetooth is ON** - Go to Settings > Bluetooth and ensure it's enabled
2. **Location Services ON** - Go to Settings > Location and enable it
3. **WiFi is ON** - Required for Nearby Connections API
4. **Devices are within 100 meters** of each other

### âœ… **Step 2: Check App Permissions**

**Required permissions that MooChat needs:**

- âœ… **Location** (Critical - needed for device discovery)
- âœ… **Bluetooth** (All Bluetooth permissions)
- âœ… **Nearby WiFi Devices** (Android 12+)
- âœ… **Camera** (for QR codes)
- âœ… **Storage** (for file transfers)

**To check/grant permissions:**

1. Go to Android Settings > Apps > MooChat > Permissions
2. Ensure ALL permissions are granted (especially Location and Bluetooth)
3. If any are denied, tap to enable them

### âœ… **Step 3: App-Level Troubleshooting**

**In MooChat app:**

1. **Check username setup** - Each device needs a unique username
2. **Restart Bluetooth services** - Close and reopen the app
3. **Clear app data** if needed - Settings > Apps > MooChat > Storage > Clear Data

### âœ… **Step 4: Device-Specific Checks**

**Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra (Android 15):**

- Go to Settings > Privacy > Permission manager > Location > MooChat > Allow all the time
- Settings > Apps > MooChat > Battery > Unrestricted

**RMX3085 (Android 13):**

- Similar permission settings
- Check if battery optimization is disabled for MooChat

### âœ… **Step 5: Network Environment**

**Test in different locations:**

1. **Try in open area** - Avoid interference from other devices
2. **Move closer** - Start with devices 2-3 meters apart
3. **Restart both devices** - Sometimes network stack needs reset

### âœ… **Step 6: MooChat App Workflow**

**Proper connection sequence:**

1. **Device 1**: Open MooChat, ensure username is set
2. **Device 2**: Open MooChat, ensure different username
3. **Both devices**: Should automatically start advertising/discovering
4. **Look for the other device** in the connections list
5. **Tap to connect** when device appears

### âœ… **Step 7: Advanced Debugging**

If the above doesn't work, the issue might be:

**Common causes:**

- **Permission issues** - Location permission is most critical
- **Android version compatibility** - Different Bluetooth APIs on Android 13 vs 15
- **Network interference** - Too many WiFi/Bluetooth devices nearby
- **Nearby Connections API limits** - Google's API has specific requirements

**Quick test:**

1. Turn OFF WiFi on both devices temporarily
2. Turn Bluetooth OFF then ON on both devices
3. Restart MooChat app on both devices
4. Check if they discover each other

### âœ… **Step 8: Alternative Solutions**

If direct Bluetooth connection fails:

1. **QR Code method** - Use the QR scanner to add contacts manually
2. **Check for app updates** - Newer versions might fix connectivity issues
3. **Factory reset permissions** - Clear all app data and re-grant permissions

### ðŸš¨ **Immediate Action Plan**

**Try this sequence right now:**

1. **On BOTH devices:**

   - Go to Settings > Apps > MooChat > Permissions
   - Enable ALL permissions, especially Location "Allow all the time"
   - Settings > Location > Turn ON
   - Settings > Bluetooth > Turn OFF then ON

2. **Test environment:**

   - Stand 3 meters apart in open area
   - Close all other apps
   - Open MooChat on Device 1, wait 10 seconds
   - Open MooChat on Device 2, wait 10 seconds
   - Check if devices appear in connections list

3. **If still no connection:**
   - Try QR code method instead
   - One device shows QR code, other scans it
   - This bypasses automatic discovery

### ðŸ“ž **Report Results**

After trying the above steps, let me know:

1. Do devices appear in each other's discovery list?
2. What error messages (if any) do you see?
3. Which Android versions are on each device?
4. Are all permissions granted?

This will help identify the specific cause of the connection issue.
