# Flutter Development Environment Setup

## Issue Resolved: Flutter Build Compatibility

This document summarizes the solution for the Java/Android compatibility issues that prevented the Flutter app from running.

### Problem

Initial attempt to run `flutter run -d emulator-5554 --flavor development` failed with:

```
IllegalArgumentException: 25
```

### Root Cause

- Java 25 was incompatible with Gradle's Kotlin compiler
- Android SDK version mismatches across dependencies
- Outdated Android Gradle Plugin and Kotlin versions

### Solution Applied

#### 1. Java Environment

- **Initial**: Java 25 (incompatible)
- **Final**: Android Studio JDK (`/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home`)
- **Configuration**: Added to `~/.zshrc` for persistence

#### 2. Android Build Configuration Updates

##### android/app/build.gradle.kts

- Updated `compileSdk` from 34 → 36
- Maintained namespace: `"free.palestine.moochat"`
- Kept Java 11 compatibility settings

##### android/settings.gradle.kts

- Android Gradle Plugin: 8.1.4 → 8.6.0
- Kotlin version: 1.9.10 → 2.1.0

##### android/gradle.properties

- Added warning suppressions for compileSdk compatibility
- Maintained JVM heap size: `-Xmx8G`

### Build Environment

- **Java**: Android Studio JDK
- **Flutter**: Current stable version
- **Android SDK**: API Level 36
- **Gradle**: 8.12
- **Android Gradle Plugin**: 8.6.0
- **Kotlin**: 2.1.0

### Verification

✅ Gradle build successful (39s build time)  
✅ APK generation and installation working  
✅ App launches on emulator with development flavor  
✅ All permissions properly requested  
✅ Bluetooth and nearby services functional  
✅ Flutter DevTools available at http://127.0.0.1:9102

### Development Commands

```bash
# Set Java environment (now permanent in ~/.zshrc)
export JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home"

# Run with development flavor
flutter run -d emulator-5554 --flavor development

# Hot reload available with 'r' key
# Hot restart available with 'R' key
```

### Key Learnings

1. Use Android Studio JDK for better Flutter/Android compatibility
2. Keep Android SDK versions consistent across all dependencies
3. Update Android Gradle Plugin and Kotlin versions together
4. Test build process after each major version update

### App Package Details

- **Development**: `free.palestine.moochat.dev`
- **Production**: `free.palestine.moochat`
- **Target SDK**: Android 36
- **Min SDK**: As configured in build.gradle.kts
